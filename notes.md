<h2> 5.1 Beneficial & Harmful Effects </h2>
<a>
    
    People create computing innovations
    
    The way people complete tasks often changes to incorporate new computing innovations
    
    Not every effect of a computing innovation is anticipated in advance
    
        A single effect can be viewed as both beneficial and harmful by different people, or even by the same person
    
        Advances in computing have generated and increased creativity in other fields, such as medicine, engineering, communications, and the arts
    
    Computing innovations can be used in ways that their creators had not originally intended: 
    
        The World Wide Web was originally intended only for rapid and easy exchange of information within the scientific community 
    
        Targeted advertising is used to help businesses, but it can be misused at both individual and aggregate levels
    
        Machine learning and data mining have enabled innovation in medicine, business, and science, but information discovered in this way has also been used to discriminate against groups of individuals
    
    Some of the ways computing innovations can be used may have a harmful impact on society, the economy, or culture 
    
    Responsible programmers try to consider the unintended ways their computing innovations can be used and the potential beneficial and harmful effects of these new uses
    
    It is not possible for a programmer to consider all the ways a computing innovation can be used
    
    Computing innovations have often had unintended beneficial effects by leading to advances in other fields
    
    Rapid sharing of a program or running a program with a large number of users can result in significant impacts beyond the intended purpose or control of the programmer

<h2> 5.2 Digital Divide </h2>

<a>
    
    Internet access varies between socioeconomic, geographic, and demographic characteristics, as well as between countries
    
    The “digital divide” refers to differing access to computing devices and the Internet, based on socioeconomic, geographic, or demographic characteristics
    
    The digital divide can affect both groups and individuals
    
    The digital divide raises issues of equity, access, and influence, both globally and locally
    
    The digital divide is affected by the actions of individuals, organizations, and governments
