## My plan for the College Board Create Task

### Program Overview
In the program, I plan on taking an **INPUT** from the **USER**. It will ask for numbers, and then once the numbers are given, it will display **(MIN) (MAX) (AVG)**. The numbers will be put into a list, and once the user selects a button, the procedure will be called and run through the numbers. Then it will display the function result, minimum will display lowest to highest, maximum will display highest to lowest, and average will average the numbers in the list.

### Inputs 
Inputs will be given as prompts for numbers by the users. Should a number not be given, a proper response will be displayed.
int(input("Numbers...etc"))

### Lists 
Lists will be exhibited inside of the code, as the numbers given by the user input will be stored inside a list.
numbers = []

### Procedure 
Procedure for us will be limited by the inputs the user gives, as well as a 5 number limit, and it will be named 'numinput()' which will be called on later.
if number > 100 or number < 0

### Sequencing
Sequencing will be shown in the 'for' loops that will be inside the functions, having 'if' and 'else' statements in proper ordering to determine things like the highest number in a list, the lowest number, and when to add to i to go through the list.

### Selection 
Selection will be shown in the 'if ' and 'else' statements, to select if a certain variable will be chosen to go in the front of a list (min/max).

### Iteration
Iteration will be shown by going through each element inside of the lists using the 'for i in range'

Inputs from the users will be run through the procedure, which's output will be called to finally print it to the user. This output will be determined by the user input, and will vary depending on what numbers are put in. This will be put into the games page as a PBL project.
