<h3>Question 18</h3>
The question asked which best decribed the roles of Public Key Encryption, which I believed was answer D because I though a public key was one key used to encrypt and decrypt data. However, that is wrong as the public key is only used for encryption, and a private key is used for decryption, which means the answer is instead A, where it is used to communicate through an open medium.
