<h2> Questions missed </h2>

<h3>Question 1</h3>
The question asked which one of the statements best describes the ability of parallel computing solutions, and I selected answer B because I forgot that parallel computing does have a limit to its efficiency, and isn't infinitely fast. The sequential portion of the algorithm still holds back the efficiency of parallel computing, which makes it answer D.

<h3>Question 20</h3>
The question was asking, what was the benefits of using MeeReader, which allows adjustments of text and screen brightness. I selected answer A because at the time I wasn't entirely sure, as the other answers didn't make sense at the time and the unintended use made somewhat sense. It makes sense to me now thought, because after rereading the question I understand that answer D was the right answer, as the brightness, text, Text to Speech and line spacing features are benefits to a person with visual impairments, rather than unintended uses.

<h3>Quesiton 27</h3>
The question asked what was the one of the benefits of using iterative development, and I answered A, which was it allowed programmers to solve otherwise unsolvable problems. This answer is wrong because iterative development allows programmers to instead identify problems in development through the iterative processes. This results in the answer being D.

<h3>Quesiton 35</h3>
The question asked why a negative value was displayed in a million+ view count video (7 digits) after a few months. Ibelieved this to be an error in analog count, but an overflow error is more suitable because it means the max amount of view was hit and it went over that amount. This makes the answer A.
