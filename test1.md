<h2> Questions missed </h2>

<h3>Question 1</h3>
The question asked which one of the statements was least likely to affect ability to process datasets, and I put option D because I believed that the storage space didn't affect it at all. However, the correct option is B because the amount of statements is irrelevant, as the efficiency of the program itself is dependant on those statements, not how many.

<h3>Question 9</h3>
The question was asking, what was the least likely to be a benefit of an improved detection system for automated detection and response calls. I answered D because I believed that it is still entirely possible for the customer to be led to the wrong department, however this is wrong because the LEAST likely possibility is B, as it is not possible to ALWAYS have a human ready for response.


<h3>Quesiton 24</h3>
The question asked what was the best way to explain how data is assembled through packets, which I selected B because I believed that the metadata was used to decrypt the data. This was wrong because the metadata is instead used for routing the data rather than decoding the data.

<h3>Quesiton 25</h3>
The question asked when it would be better to use a Creative Commons vs a traditional copyright. I selected D, because I believed that a Creative Commons would be better to restrict sharing over peer to peer networks, however my interpretation of the Creative Commons was wrong. Creative Commons is entirely open for use, rather than what I believed to be open but with rules. This makes C the right option because free download is better in Creative Commons versus a copyright.

<h3>Question 29</h3>
The question was asking if the program worked as intended. I got this question wrong because I overlooked the fact that even though the program displays the right value for this set of values, it sets sum equal to the first value in the list, which means if the first valeu in the list wasn't 0, the list wouldn't work, meaning that C is the correct answer.
