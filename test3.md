<h3>Question 1</h3>
The question asked which one of the statements was least likely to affect ability to process datasets, and I put option D because I believed that the storage space didn't affect it at all. However, the correct option is B because the amount of statements is irrelevant, as the efficiency of the program itself is dependant on those statements, not how many.

<h3>Question 9</h3>
The question was asking, what was the least likely to be a benefit of an improved detection system for automated detection and response calls. I answered D because I believed that it is still entirely possible for the customer to be led to the wrong department, however this is wrong because the LEAST likely possibility is B, as it is not possible to ALWAYS have a human ready for response.


<h3>Quesiton 24</h3>
The question asked what was the best way to explain how data is assembled through packets, which I selected B because I believed that the metadata was used to decrypt the data. This was wrong because the metadata is instead used for routing the data rather than decoding the data.

<h3>Quesiton 27</h3>
The question asked what was the one of the benefits of using iterative development, and I answered A, which was it allowed programmers to solve otherwise unsolvable problems. This answer is wrong because iterative development allows programmers to instead identify problems in development through the iterative processes. This results in the answer being D.

<h3>Quesiton 35</h3>
The question asked why a negative value was displayed in a million+ view count video (7 digits) after a few months. Ibelieved this to be an error in analog count, but an overflow error is more suitable because it means the max amount of view was hit and it went over that amount. This makes the answer A.
